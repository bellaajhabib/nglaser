        <p>This website was built using symfony 2, sonata admin bundle, and backbone marionette. I wanted to create an example of how you would build a backend with sonata admin and a frontend with marionette. Please checkout the video below to see the detailed explanation of how this website works. If you have any question feel free to email me at glaserpower@gmail.com.</p>
